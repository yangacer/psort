1. Multiple Keys and Compare Methods

-k field_name compare_method [-k ...]

e.g. ./psort -k '@U:string' -k '@s:uint'

This configuration will let psort compare records with "@U:" 
field in lexicalgraphical order, so call string comparison. 
If this field of two records are equal, then psort will 
compare "@s:" fields numerically. Notice the order of -k 
options is the preference of keys.

2. Memory Limitation and Reservation

-M integer[k|m|g] -r percentage

e.g. -M 100m -r 20

The 100m argument indicates that the maximum memroy usage
is 100 MB. The -r option let psort preserve 20% of 100m
in the first phase, to reduce probability of repartition.
